# OmniIsle — native Forge 1.20.1 port (development)

This repository is for a standalone **Minecraft Forge 1.20.1** port of **OmniIsle 0.5.0**. A native Forge JAR has been compiled and dedicated-server generation has passed; client editor verification is still in progress. Treat it as a test build until confirmed in-game.

## Canonical upstream references

- **Exact Minecraft version:** [OmniIsle `fabric/1.20.1`](https://github.com/y9hack337/OmniIsle/tree/fabric/1.20.1), pinned at commit [`5f4b5bf`](https://github.com/y9hack337/OmniIsle/commit/5f4b5bf94761d640f5351ca90cb6825c6e9f6dac).
- **Loader conversion reference:** [OmniIsle `neoforge/1.21.1`](https://github.com/y9hack337/OmniIsle/tree/neoforge/1.21.1), pinned at [`051aba8`](https://github.com/y9hack337/OmniIsle/commit/051aba887c0c05346b8cbe6eab0e5434d6503b9c).
- [Main upstream repository](https://github.com/y9hack337/OmniIsle). **Do not use `main` as the source for Minecraft 1.20.1**; it targets newer Minecraft APIs.

Target: **Minecraft 1.20.1 · Forge 47.3.0 · Java 17**. This is **Forge**, not NeoForge, Fabric, or a Connector/Sinytra wrapper.

## Requirements for feature parity

The port must preserve the original island generation, coastline/deep-ocean transition, biome selection, world-creation preset, custom brush editor, custom mask export/persistence, structure placement, and original supported commands. The editor and per-world datapack persistence are not optional features.

**Current status:** GitHub Actions builds a native Forge 1.20.1 JAR using the version-pinned upstream references and conversion script. A prior GitHub Actions run compiled a JAR, validated resource JSON, and started the dedicated Forge server with the OmniIsle world preset successfully. The remaining acceptance gate is client-side verification of opening and rendering the island editor, followed by actual gameplay testing. See [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Cyberspectraa/ForgePort/actions) for logs and the downloadable build artifact.

## Licensing

Upstream GitHub source is distributed under GPL-3.0. Retain copyright notices and the GPL license when porting. The separately distributed 1.20.1 Fabric JAR carries a different license declaration in its metadata, so maintain GPL compliance for public distribution and check upstream licensing details. This is an unofficial port.
